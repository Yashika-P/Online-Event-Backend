Installation
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js (v14.x or later)
MongoDB (For local development, or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting)
npm (Node package manager)
Steps to Install
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-backend.git
cd event-backend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables (see section below for environment variables).

Run the application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on http://localhost:5000.

Technologies
Node.js: JavaScript runtime to build server-side applications.
Express: Web framework for Node.js to build APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store event and user data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB to interact with the database.
JWT (JSON Web Token): Used for user authentication and token management.
CORS: Middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Bcrypt: Used to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
dotenv: To manage environment variables.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project and include the following variables:

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string (local or MongoDB Atlas).
JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens.
PORT: The port the backend will run on (default is 5000).
NODE_ENV: Set to development for local development or production for production.
Example .env file:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/eventdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
Running the Application
Locally:
After installing the dependencies and setting up the .env file, run the following command to start the application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend on http://localhost:5000.

Production:
For production, ensure that your .env variables are correctly set for your live environment (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret) and use a service like Render or Heroku to deploy your application.

Deployment
To deploy your backend, you can use services like Render, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.

Render: Follow the steps in the Render documentation to deploy the backend.

Heroku: Use the following steps to deploy on Heroku:

Install the Heroku CLI and log in to your Heroku account.

Run the following commands to deploy:

bash
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku master
heroku open
